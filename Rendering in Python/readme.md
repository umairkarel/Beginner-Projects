# 3D Rendering in Python

1. Rendering a 3D cube on a 2D plane using **Rotation** and **Projection Matrices**
2. Rendering a 4D tesseract on a 2D plane. here, we first project 4D object on a 3D plane then, 3D projection matrix is again Projected on a 2D plane.

# Requirements
* Python
* Pygame
* Numpy
